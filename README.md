# Spomoo Android App
The [original](https://github.com/juliusmuet/Spomoo) Spomoo Android App was developed by Julius Müther and has been further developed by four other students as part of the "Android App Evolution" internship at RUB.

Following features have been added to the project: Video Library, Video Notifications, Water Tracker, Digit Span Task. The user can access the video library to watch short exercise videos. At random times, the app will notify the user twice a day to remind the user to do these exercises. In addition, the user can track how much water they drank, and they can also do the digit-span task to test their short-term memory.
